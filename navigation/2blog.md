# A Blog Looking Back: My Growth This Semester 


# 1. Comparing Yourself to the Beginning of the Year 💭

## What skills did you not have then, but have now?
At the beginning of the year, I barely knew how to use most of the tools in computer science. My coding skills were basically limited to making text bold in Google Docs. VS Code was a mysterious shape, GitHub sounded like a hub for nerdy cats, and if you'd told me I'd be using a "terminal," I'd have assumed I was joining the Intelligence Agency or something.

I didn’t really understand VS Code, GitHub, and how websites were structured. Now, after one semester of AP CSP, I have more understanding of writing code in both JavaScript and Python, I am able to build pages on my website, and organize my files correctly.

My confidence has grown a lot because debugging no longer feels impossible. 

I’m better at using AI to help myself, finding errors, checking the console, and fixing mistakes. I’m also more organized with my repositories and better at managing my time during long assignments. Collaborating with others has become easier too.

# 2. Key Takeaways From the Three Sprints 🗡️


## Sprint 1: Tools

This was the "I have no idea what I'm doing" phase. I made more commits with messages like "please work" and "idk what this does". Learning that the terminal isn't just for cool hackers in movies was a revelation. When Jekyll finally built my site without 50 errors, I felt a power surge normally reserved for discovering a new keyboard shortcut.
This sprint helped me understand the basics: VS Code, GitHub, the Terminal, and Jekyll.
At first, GitHub was confusing because I didn’t understand how commits and pushes worked, but now it makes sense. Learning how the Terminal controls environments and how Jekyll builds my website made me feel like a real developer.

## Sprint 2: Fundamentals of JavaScript/Python

The **Onboarding Adventure Hacks assignment** was my first solo coding victory. It was like giving a caveman a stick and coming back to find he'd built a slightly wobbly but functional chair. I was so proud.
I learned loops, conditionals, variables, functions, and how programs process data.
I feel a little more comfortable with Python because the syntax is cleaner, but I’m improving in JavaScript too.
One assignment I’m proud of was the game hacks, it was the first assignment I did by myself, but I figured it out.

## Sprint 3: Digital Famine

In this sprint, I was getting used to code, I worked with knowledges and used it to build my team's project. I learned what an AI API is and how to use it.
The part of my project that worked best was organizing the words of knowledges and showing it in a way that made sense. Even when code doesn't work, I learned to fix them piece by piece.

# 3. N@tM (Night at the Museum) Reflection 🌃

N@tM was exciting because I got to share my project with real visitors.
People were curious about my project, and a few even said they liked the design and the idea behind it.
One thing that surprised me was how explaining something out loud made me notice small improvements I could make.
Next time, I’d prepare a shorter explanation and add more visuals and funny factors in my contexts so people will understand the project faster in a fun way.And free candy. Everything is better with free candy.

# 4. Project Next Steps 💡

If I had more time, I would:

- Add more features to make the project interactive

- Improve the UI to look cleaner and more professional

- Use better data or add graphs

- Add animations to make it more fun

- Organize my code so that future me doesn't want to punch past me in the face.


# 5. What You Want to Learn Next in CompSci 🖥️

Next semester, I want to learn:

- More JavaScript—especially functions, DOM manipulation, and animations

- React or Next.js so I can build real web apps

- Data visualization to make projects look more professional

- Algorithms so I can improve my problem-solving skills

# 6. Analytics Review 🏛️

Our website was commented great, The final quiz were the greatest.I will improve the funny factor if I can do it again. 

# 7. MCQ Review 🚦
### Score: 39/66

## Corrections:


### Q1 - Variable Swapping
```pseudocode
temp ← first
first ← second
second ← temp
```
**Analysis**: The code segment correctly swaps the values of `first` and `second` using a temporary variable.

### Q7 - Variable Assignment
```pseudocode
start ← 1
end ← 20
current ← 3
start ← current
current ← current + 1
```
**Final Values**: 
- `start` = 3
- `current` = 4

### Q9 - Debugging Strategy
**Technique**: Incrementally adding code segments to correct, working programs helps identify new errors as they are introduced.

### Q14 - Program Output Comparison
**Program A**: Displays `1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10`
**Program B**: Displays `2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11`
**Difference**: Each value in Program B is one greater than the corresponding value in Program A.

### Q28 - Character Encoding
**Calculation**: 2⁸ = 256 characters
**Conclusion**: 8 bits allow for up to 256 unique characters.

### Q30 - Execution Time Analysis
**Procedure Calls**:
- 1 call before loop
- 4 calls inside loop (one for each list entry)
**Total**: 5 calls × 1 hour each = 5 hours execution time

### Q33 - Boolean Logic
**Flowchart Logic**: 
```pseudocode
include ← (floor > 10) OR (bedrooms = 3)
```

### Q38 - Conditional Cost
**Condition**: `count MOD 10 = 0` evaluates to true when count is a multiple of 10
**Effect**: Sets `cost` to 0 when condition is met

### Q50 - Search Algorithm
**Algorithm Type**: Linear search
**Characteristics**: 
- Sequentially compares each element
- Works on unsorted lists
- Stops when target found or end of list reached

### Q54 - Generalization
**Specific Procedures**: `square(n)` and `cube(n)`
**Generalized Procedure**: `Power(n, m)` calculates nᵐ

### Q55 - Logical Error
**Expression**: `(response = "y") AND (response = "yes")`
**Problem**: Always evaluates to false since response cannot equal both values simultaneously

### Q56 - Loop Analysis
**Loop Behavior**:
- `count` starts at 1, increments by 2
- Iterates 10 times
- Sums odd integers from 1 to 19

### Q60 - Data Abstraction
**Example**: Creating a list of names
**Benefit**: Makes program complexity easier to manage

### Q65 - Loop Condition Issue
**Problem**: If `y` is negative, loop condition `count = y` will never be true since `count` starts at 0 and increases.


### Q12 - User Growth Prediction
**Pattern**: Increases by ~0.5 million users per year
**Year 12 Prediction**: 30.2 + (2 × 0.5) = 31.2 million users

### Q13 - Character Trend
**Observation**: Average characters per message decreased after mobile app release

### Q22 - Boolean Condition
**Expression**: `counter > (total / 2)`
**Meaning**: True when number of temperatures ≥90° is greater than 50% of total entries

### Q40 - Score Analysis
**Determinable Metrics**:
- Average total points per student
- Average increase due to replacement policy  
- Proportion of students who improved scores

### Q43 - Algorithm Efficiency
**Pattern**: n² steps for n items
**Classification**: Polynomial time - runs in reasonable time


### Q44 - Overflow Error
**4-bit Representation Range**: 0 to 15 (2⁴ = 16 values)
**Overflow Operation**: 10 + 7 = 17 > 15

### Q45 - Boolean Algebra
**Expression**: `NOT(P AND Q)`
**Truth Table**: False only when both P and Q are true

### Q46 - Undecidable Problems
**Definition**: No algorithm can be constructed that always leads to a correct yes-or-no answer

### Q53 - Machine Learning
**Definition**: Computer analyzing data to make predictions and decisions based on trends


### Q23 - Network Routing
**Observation**: Only one path from P to S (P→R→Q→S)
**Implication**: Redundant routing impossible with single path

### Q58 - Crowdsourcing & Internet
**Benefits**:
- Provides tools, information, and knowledge
- Lowers geographic barriers
**Limitation**: Cannot solve problems that require unreasonable time

### Q62 - Collaborative Editing
**Advantage**: Multiple perspectives can contribute through editing

### Q64 - Cloud Computing
**Critical Consideration**: Security to protect users' private data

## What concepts I misunderstood:
 Undecidable problem, internet context and analyze data...

I will read the data more carefully, and practice with similar questions

# 8. Something Cool You’d Like to Share 🛎️

One cool thing this semester was finally fixing a bug that kept breaking my JavaScript page. It turned out to be the Java symbol we use to run Javascript in the python enviroment. After finding it, the whole program worked perfectly.

I also discovered shortcuts in VS Code, like selecting multiple lines at once, which made editing much faster.
Overall, even though this semester was challenging, it was fun seeing myself improve.
This semester was challenging, occasionally frustrating, and deeply fun.
